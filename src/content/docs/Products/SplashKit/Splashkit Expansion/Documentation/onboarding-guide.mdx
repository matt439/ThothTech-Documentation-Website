## Introduction

This guide will cover all the steps required to get contributing to the splashkit-core repository.
Feel free to skip steps which you have already completed or are familiar with.

## Installing WSL

WSL is a built-in Linux distribution virtual machine for Windows. splashkit-core will be installed
to the Linux distribution. The official Microsoft documentation provides high-quality instructions
on how to install WSL: [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). This
guide has been tested with the default Ubuntu distribution, but others may also work.

### Installing Visual Studio Code

Once WSL has been installed to Windows, Visual Studio Code needs to be installed to WSL.
The Microsoft documentation is again the best reference for this process:
[Install VS Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode).

### Installing Git

Now Git must be installed to WSL. Follow the Microsoft installation instructions:
[Install Git](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git).

### Installing Windows Terminal (optional)

Windows Terminal is an updated Command Prompt with many useful features. It is not mandatory to
install, however it is recommended due to its ease of use. More information about Windows Terminal
can be found here: [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/).It can be
installed through the Microsoft Store.

By default, new tabs will open as a Command Prompt, with WSL terminals being accessible with the
down-arrow. Since WSL will be used so frequently, there is the option to change the default tab to
WSL. Open the settings by clicking the down arrow and selecting ‘Settings’. In the ‘Startup’ tab,
‘Default profile’ allows you to change the default tab type to WSL.

## Setting Up splashkit-core

Now that WSL is fully configured, it is time to install the splashkit-core repository.

### Forking splashkit-core Repository

A fork is a copy of a repository which allows for independent development without interfering with
the primary repository itself. To create a personal fork of splashkit-core, navigate to
[GitHub splashkit-core](https://github.com/splashkit/splashkit-core) and click ‘Fork’. On the next
page, keep the default name and click ‘Create fork’.

### Cloning splashkit-core Repository

Open a WSL terminal and change directory to your home with:

```sh
cd
```

Note that this guide clones the repository to the home directory, but feel free to move its location.
Now initiate the clone process of your fork with:

```sh
git clone --recursive -j2 https://github.com/{user name}/splashkit-core.git
```

splashkit-core contains multiple submodules (separate repositories which splashkit-core depends upon).
The `--recursive` argument ensures that the submodules are also downloaded when calling clone. Wait
for the download to complete before continuing to the next step.

## Contributing to splashkit-core

It is now time to start fixing bugs and adding functionality to splashkit-core.

### Creating Branch

When modifying the repository, changes should be logically grouped together onto separate branches.
To create a branch, open a WSL terminal and navigate to the `splashkit-core` folder with:

```sh
cd
cd splashkit-core
```

Check the current branch with:

```sh
git branch
```

Create a new branch using the current branch as a base:

```sh
git branch {new branch name}
```

Swap to new branch with:

```sh
git checkout {new branch name}
```

Now that a new branch is created and active, development can begin.

### Building the Test Programs

You cannot create new programs with splashkit-core as you do when using the traditional SplashKit
library. Instead, two programs are generated which can be configured to test its functionality:
`sktest` and `skunit_tests`. They are built with CMake using a preconfigured `CMakeLists.txt` file.
Open a WSL terminal and enter:

```sh
cd
cd splashkit-core/projects/cmake
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .
make
```

### Running the Test Programs

To run the test programs, open a WSL terminal and enter:

```sh
cd
cd splashkit-core/bin
```

Then for sktest:

```sh
./sktest
```

Or for skunit_tests:

```sh
./skunit_tests
```

### Making Changes

`sktest` is built with the .cpp files from `~/splashkit-core/coreskd/src/test/`. To add your own
tests, modify one or more of the files such as `test_animation.cpp`.

`skunit_tests` is built with the .cpp files from `~/splashkit-core/coreskd/src/test/unit_tests/`.
When it runs, all unit tests from all files in this folder are executed. Additional files can be
added to this folder if necessary. If adding a new file, copy the structure from one of the existing
unit test files. Critically, `#include "catch.hpp"` must be present in the file for it to be compiled
into `skunit_tests`. Beyond that, the hierarchy of, `TEST_CASE > SECTION > ASSERTION` should be
followed to improve readability and tracing of errors.

### Testing Changes

If a change is made to the code, the test programs need to be rebuilt. In a WSL terminal enter:

```sh
cd
cd splashkit-core/projects/cmake
make
```

If any files were created or deleted, the CMake files need to be regenerated. In that case use:

```sh
cd
cd splashkit-core/projects/cmake
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .
make
```

### Documenting Changes

Local changes can be tested building and running the test programs. However, once changes are to be
submitted for review, they need to be staged, committed and pushed. It is good practice to perform
multiple smaller commits with meaningful descriptions rather than a single monolithic commit. In
addition, pushing commits to GitHub provides a layer of backup in case of local machine failure.

### Creating a Pull Request

Once you have completed work on a particular branch, a pull request (PR) can be made. At this point
there are now three relevant splashkit-core repositories at play: splashkit-core itself, thoth-tech’s
fork, and your personal fork. During trimester, PRs should be made against the thoth-tech fork. The
PR template provides a framework for how to structure the associated PR documentation.

### Responding to Peer Reviews

If changes are requested during a PR review, pushing further commits to the same branch will
automatically be added to the PR.
